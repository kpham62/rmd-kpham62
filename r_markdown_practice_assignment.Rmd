## Test Report

In this calculation, from national COVID-19 case and death data from NY Times, the total number of cases occurred in the U.S. was 46058641 while the total number of deaths in the U.S. was 746688.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("analysis.R")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(cases_plot)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
